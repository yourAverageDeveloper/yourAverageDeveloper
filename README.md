### About me and where I am today

<hr />

I am a frontend web developer and I work with React and it's friends primarily. I am a HUGE fan of CSS and I love writing it whenever and wherever possible. I am also a big TypeScript fan I absolutely LOVE it. There's not a single project that I work on without it and I feel no shame in saying no to the projects that don't use it. I have worked with GraphQL and Gatsby as well but I believe Gatsby has a bigger learning curve when compared to Next.js. Learning how Next.js worked was very seamless for me and I am glad I got to become a JavaScript developer in this era of web development.

### Why I got into Computer Science

<hr />

I graduated from FAST-NUCES, Islamabad, Pakistan in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and I still remember the reason why I choose this field. I loved designs and I wanted to become a graphic designer working for big organizations. I wanted to design assets like game characters and backgrounds that would later on be used in big things or at least, that's what I thought I'd be learning when I joined the university but turns out, not only I was never taught graphic design, the first week of my university I was thrown into the ugly command line interface with absolutely no knowledge of how to operate it. And we started running linux commands in it by just looking at the slides and following the instructor. I WAS HORRIFIED.

### How I got to the Web

<hr />

When I was in university, I found out soon that everyone was learning something new and I was sitting there with my Cs and Ds in almost every subject and absolutely no skill. So, the guilt started eating me up and one day I decided I was going to do something about it. So, I started out with C++ and started developing games with it. And not gonna lie, it really helped me a lot. I learnt about Object Oriented Design concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. I also familiarized myself with some advanced concepts like pipes and real time data but it always felt like I wasn't built for this.

Soon I realized C++ wasn't doing it for me and it was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life so I switched fields and took my first ever course on web development on Udemy. It was a simple code along for a single HTML/CSS page with very basic stuff inside it but I really felt something refreshing in there.

So this is where my journey as a web developer starts. Since then, I started taking online courses, reading books and building small projects of my own. After 2 years, in my university's final year project, I built an online SVG editor tool for the web with a friend where users could draw shapes, build animations and layer them and do all kinds of cool stuff that graphic designers do. You could say I bridged the gap between what I wanted to do when I joined the university which was graphic designing with what I was forced to do which was computer programming and I personally think this was the best thing that ever happened to me.

It reminds me of a quote I read somewhere on LinkedIn (or perhaps it was Twitter):

<br />

> Do what you love doing and you'll never have to work a day in your life.

<br />

For me, I have never heard and experienced a truer quote than this.
